SEO Audit Tool
The SEO Audit Tool is a Python-based program that performs a comprehensive analysis of a given website based on the principles of E-E-A-T (Experience, Expertise, Authority, and Trust), YMYL (Your Money or Your Life), and Google Medic. It provides a content quality rating on a scale of 1 to 10, and offers detailed recommendations for optimizing the website's on-page, off-page, technical, and local aspects.
Modules
The SEO Audit Tool consists of the following modules:
* GUI Module (gui.py): Handles the graphical user interface for the application.
* Web Scraper Module (web_scraper.py): Crawls the website and extracts relevant data.
* Text Parser Module (text_parser.py): Processes and organizes the extracted data.
* E-E-A-T & YMYL Analyzer Module (eat_ymyl_analyzer.py): Analyzes the content based on E-E-A-T and YMYL principles.
* Off-Page Analyzer Module (off_page_analyzer.py): Analyzes backlinks, social media presence, and online reputation.
* Technical Analyzer Module (technical_analyzer.py): Evaluates website performance, mobile-friendliness, crawlability, and indexability.
* Local Optimization Analyzer Module (local_optimization_analyzer.py): Assesses local business listings, local keyword usage, and local link building.
* Recommendation Generator Module (recommendation_generator.py): Generates actionable recommendations for on-page, off-page, technical, and local optimizations.
* Main Module (main.py): Coordinates the execution of the program and integrates all other modules.
Installation
1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Install the required Python libraries:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Note: Replace the contents of requirements.txt with the specific libraries and their versions you need for your project, e.g., BeautifulSoup, Scrapy, spaCy, NLTK, etc.
Usage
To use the SEO Audit Tool, run the main.py file:
python main.py

The program will initiate the GUI (or command line interface, depending on your implementation) and ask the user for a URL to analyze. It will then perform the analysis, generate recommendations, and display the results.
