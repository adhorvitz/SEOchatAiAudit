I would like you to provide a content quality rating based on a scale of 1 to 10 where 10 is best and 0 is worst. You should take into consideration - how well the content is written, how well it aligns with Google's E-E-A-T guidelines for human quality raters, how well structured the content is, if it makes it clear what is on offer, is it grammatically correct and well written and does it fit the end user's intent when comparing the main H1 tag to the body of the content. You should provide clear, actionable recommendations for any areas where the content has an issue as well as guidance to bolster expertise and trust where applicable. You should not self-reference and should avoid making any assumptions, the content for you to audit can be found here: ${url}`;
